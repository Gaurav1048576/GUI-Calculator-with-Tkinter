# GUI-Calculator-with-Tkinter
A simple Graphical user interface application with Tkinter library in python

My first Python, project GUI applications always amazes me i tried making a (regular+scientific) switchable calculator with Tkinter GUI library
You can switch between regular and scietific calci from the menu bar tough the scientific part is not yet fully coded, some work is yet to be done but the regular one works!
the geomertry of app is 480x600 in regular mode and when switched to scientific it turns to 1024*600

i have also converted this code into .exe file to be able to run on your operating system
for more info you can go to about option in the app and find my details there! 
:)
